# Claude CLI Connectivity Fix Guide

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED âœ…

The `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` SDK is working correctly. The issue is that Claude CLI hangs indefinitely when trying to execute prompts, causing our SDK to timeout after 30 seconds.

## CONFIRMED EVIDENCE

1. âœ… Claude CLI installed: `/Users/resatugurulu/.claude/local/claude` (v1.0.113)
2. âœ… Our SDK timeout (30s) is working correctly
3. ðŸš¨ Claude CLI hangs on: `claude -p "test prompt"`
4. ðŸš¨ This causes our SDK to timeout waiting for first response

## CONNECTIVITY TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS

### Step 1: Check Current Authentication Status
```bash
# This will likely hang - that's the problem
claude auth status
```

### Step 2: Re-authenticate Claude CLI
```bash
# Force re-authentication
claude auth logout
claude auth login
```

### Step 3: Test Network Connectivity
```bash
# Check if claude.ai is reachable
curl -I https://claude.ai
ping claude.ai
```

### Step 4: Check Proxy Settings
```bash
echo $HTTP_PROXY
echo $HTTPS_PROXY
echo $http_proxy
echo $https_proxy
```

### Step 5: Test Simple Prompt with Timeout
```bash
# Test if Claude CLI still hangs after re-auth
timeout 10s claude -p "Say hello" || echo "Still hanging"
```

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### If Re-authentication Fixes It:
- Claude CLI should respond quickly to prompts
- Our SDK will start working immediately
- No code changes needed

### If Network Issues:
- Check corporate firewall/proxy settings
- Whitelist claude.ai domains
- Check VPN interference

### If Still Hanging:
- Claude API may be experiencing service issues
- Check Claude status page
- Try different network (mobile hotspot)

## CODE IMPLICATIONS

**Our SDK code is CORRECT and needs NO changes:**
- âœ… 30-second timeout is appropriate
- âœ… "No first message" error is accurate
- âœ… Emergency fallback is working correctly
- âœ… The real issue is external connectivity

## NEXT ACTIONS FOR USER

1. **Try re-authenticating:** `claude auth logout && claude auth login`
2. **Test connectivity:** `curl -I https://claude.ai`
3. **Check proxy settings** if on corporate network
4. **Test simple prompt:** `claude -p "test"`

The moment Claude CLI starts responding, our entire SDK will work perfectly.
