# GRAPHYN.md - Living Project Memory

## Project Vision
Graphyn Code transforms Claude Code from a tool into an intelligent development partner by orchestrating context-aware AI agents that understand your project deeply.

## Architecture Decisions

### 2025-01-07: CLI Intelligence Through Agent Consumption
**Decision**: CLI becomes intelligent by consuming Graphyn agents, not building its own intelligence.
**Rationale**: Agents are the intelligence layer; CLI should orchestrate them seamlessly.
**Impact**: CLI focuses on being the best interface to agent capabilities.

### 2025-01-07: CLI as Standard API Client
**Decision**: Graphyn CLI uses the same APIs as any other client - no special endpoints.
**Rationale**: Simplifies architecture, maintains consistency, reduces API surface area.
**Impact**: Focus shifts to orchestration intelligence rather than API complexity.

### 2025-01-06: Multi-Thread Orchestration Pattern
**Decision**: Each agent gets its own thread, linked by session metadata.
**Rationale**: Enables parallel agent execution and coordinated responses.
**Impact**: Better performance, cleaner separation of concerns.

### 2025-01-18: Ink Framework Migration Started
**Decision**: Migrate from Commander.js to Ink (React for terminals) for modern reactive UI.
**Rationale**: Better user experience, real-time updates, component reusability.
**Impact**: Complete rewrite of CLI interface, ESM modules, new architecture patterns.

### 2025-01-05: Terminal Integration via Temp Files (UPDATED 2025-01-18)
**Original Decision**: Use temporary files for context passing due to Claude Code terminal constraints.
**Update**: Direct integration discovered! Claude accepts content as command argument.
**New Approach**: `claude "content"` works without terminal conflicts.
**Impact**: Seamless integration achieved - no temp files or manual steps needed!

## Technical Learnings

### API Integration Patterns
- GraphynClient handles all API communication
- SSE streams for real-time responses
- Session metadata links related threads
- Standard error handling across all endpoints

### Terminal Constraints (RESOLVED - Direct Integration Works!)
- Both Claude Code and Graphyn CLI use Ink framework
- Previous assumption: Cannot have two Ink apps running simultaneously
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Claude Code accepts content as direct argument!
- **Solution**: Pass content directly: `claude "content"` - no terminal conflicts!
- No temp files needed - direct integration achieved!

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- Threads created in parallel for performance
- Agents added as participants to threads
- Responses aggregated from multiple SSE streams
- Session ID tracks related operations

## Current State (Updated 2025-01-19 - Ink Migration Progress)
