# GRAPHYN.md - AI Agent Editorial Direction

This file defines how your Graphyn Code agents should behave and communicate. Similar to how Claude Code uses CLAUDE.md, this file guides your specialized development agents.

## üìã Agent Behavior Guidelines

### Communication Style
- **Tone**: [Professional/Casual/Technical] - Choose your preferred communication style
- **Verbosity**: [Concise/Detailed/Balanced] - How much explanation you want
- **Code Comments**: [Minimal/Standard/Extensive] - Level of code documentation
- **Error Handling**: [Basic/Robust/Paranoid] - How thorough error checking should be

### Development Preferences

#### Code Style
```yaml
# Language preferences
languages:
  backend: ["TypeScript", "Node.js", "Python"]
  frontend: ["React", "Next.js", "TypeScript"]
  database: ["PostgreSQL", "Redis"]

# Framework preferences  
frameworks:
  backend: ["Encore.dev", "Express", "Fastify"]
  frontend: ["Next.js", "Vite", "Tailwind CSS"]
  testing: ["Jest", "Vitest", "Playwright"]

# Architecture patterns
patterns:
  - "Microservices"
  - "Clean Architecture" 
  - "Domain-Driven Design"
  - "Event Sourcing"
```

#### Best Practices
- **Security First**: Always consider security implications
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency

## üéØ Project-Specific Context

### Current Project
```yaml
name: "My Project"
type: "Web Application"
tech_stack:
  backend: "Encore.dev + TypeScript"
  frontend: "Next.js + React"
  database: "PostgreSQL + Redis"
  deployment: "Vercel + Encore Cloud"

business_domain: "SaaS Platform"
scale: "Startup (1-10 users initially)"
timeline: "MVP in 2 months"
```

### Thread-Based Architecture Context
```yaml
# Core Architecture
system_type: "Thread-Based Agent Builder"
philosophy: "Everything is a conversation thread - no forms, no wizards"
core_components:
  - "Thread System: Foundation for all interactions"
  - "Letta Integration: Multi-tenant AI agent management"
  - "SSE Streaming: Real-time communication"
  - "Builder Agent: Conversational agent creation"

# Thread System
threads:
  types: ["builder", "testing", "production"]
  database_schema:
    - threads: "id, type, metadata, created_at"
    - thread_participants: "thread_id, participant_type, participant_id"
    - messages: "thread_id, sender_type, sender_id, content, metadata"
  api_endpoints:
    - "POST /api/threads - Create thread"
    - "GET /api/threads/:id - Get thread details"
    - "POST /api/threads/:id/messages - Send message"
    - "GET /api/threads/:id/stream - SSE streaming"

# Letta Integration
letta:
  connection_pattern: "identifier_key: org_${organization.clerk_id}"
  multi_tenant: true
  agent_types: ["builder", "custom"]
  error_handling: "Type casting with proper error boundaries"

# SSE Streaming Patterns
streaming:
  endpoints: "/api/threads/:id/stream"
  reconnection: "Auto-reconnect with backoff"
  buffering: "Message queue during disconnection"
  event_types: ["message", "participant_join", "participant_leave", "status"]

# Agent Management
agents:
  creation_flow: "Thread conversation ‚Üí Config extraction ‚Üí Agent creation"
  testing_mode: "WhatsApp-style - invite agents to threads"
  learning: "Automatic on agent removal from test threads"
  versioning: "agent_versions table with pattern detection"
```

### Integration Patterns
```yaml
# Backend ‚Üî Frontend
sse_contract:
  event_format: '{ type: string, data: any, timestamp: number }'
  reconnection: "Frontend handles with useThreadStream hook"
  thread_types: "Backend enforces, Frontend displays"

# Backend ‚Üî CLI  
api_authentication: "API keys in .graphynrc"
thread_access: "Same SSE endpoints as web"
bulk_operations: "Special CLI endpoints for batch work"

# Frontend ‚Üî CLI
shared_state: "Both can participate in same threads"
real_time: "Changes visible instantly across interfaces"
export_import: "Standardized thread format"
```

### Performance Requirements
```yaml
thread_creation: "< 500ms"
sse_first_token: "< 200ms"
message_delivery: "< 100ms"
agent_join_leave: "< 1 second"
```

### Team Preferences
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Testing**: Minimum 80% test coverage required
- **Documentation**: All APIs must have OpenAPI specs
- **Deployment**: Use CI/CD with automated testing
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and metrics

## üöÄ Workflow Integration
