## Why Graphyn?

We believe AI assistants should understand your project deeply‚Äînot just respond to prompts. Graphyn gives Claude Code specialized agents that know your stack, follow your standards, and evolve with your codebase.

**One command. Full context. Real development.**

## Install

### npm (recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @graphyn/code
```

### Script install
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuego-wtf/graphyn-code/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Just talk to graphyn - it launches Claude instantly
graphyn backend "design a REST API for user auth"
graphyn frontend "create a dashboard with charts"
graphyn architect "review my database schema"
```

That's it. No setup. No configuration. Just start building.

## The Philosophy

**Documentation should be alive.** Not static files that rot in repos, but living knowledge that grows with your project. Every interaction teaches Graphyn about your codebase. Every decision gets remembered. Every pattern gets recognized.

This is the future of development: AI that truly understands your project.

## Your AI Development Team

### üîß Backend Agent
Expert in APIs, databases, and server architecture. Knows Encore.ts, Node.js, and cloud patterns.

### üé® Frontend Agent  
Master of UI/UX, React, and modern web. Builds components that users love.

### üèóÔ∏è Architect Agent
Your technical advisor. Reviews designs, suggests improvements, ensures best practices.

## Living Documentation

Create a `GRAPHYN.md` file in your project:

```markdown
# Our Stack
- Backend: Encore.ts with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind
- Auth: Clerk

# Our Standards
- TypeScript everywhere
- Tests for critical paths
- Accessibility first
```

Now every agent knows your project's DNA.

## Coming Soon

- **Context Evolution**: Graphyn learns from Claude's work
- **Team Sync**: Share knowledge across your organization
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect and suggest improvements
- **Sleep-time Compute**: AI improves while you rest

## Start Building

```bash
graphyn auth gph_xxxxxxxxxxxx  # Optional - get key at graphyn.xyz
graphyn backend "let's build something amazing"
```

**Built for developers who ship fast and dream big.**
