🚀 **LATEST**: Mission Control interface with real-time Claude streaming!

🎨 **NEW**: Beautiful interactive CLI with real-time updates, powered by React!

🔥 **GAME CHANGER**: Transform your static `.claude/agents` into living, learning AI agents!

## Why Graphyn?

We believe AI assistants should understand your project deeply—not just respond to prompts. Graphyn gives Claude Code specialized agents that know your stack, follow your standards, and evolve with your codebase.

**One command. Full context. Real development.**

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @graphyn/code
```

Zero configuration needed—it just works.

## Platform Support

- ✅ **macOS** - Fully supported
- ✅ **Linux** - Fully supported  
- ⚠️ **Windows** - Experimental (WSL recommended)


## Quick Start

```bash
# Natural language queries launch Mission Control
graphyn "help me understand this repo"
graphyn "add user authentication"
graphyn "create a dashboard component"

# Agent-specific queries
graphyn backend "add user authentication"
graphyn frontend "create a dashboard"  
graphyn architect "review my API design"
graphyn design figma.com/file/...  # Figma to code

# Interactive Mission Control mode
graphyn
```

## 🚀 Mission Control Interface

Experience the future of AI development with our flight cockpit interface:

- **🎯 Natural Language Processing**: Just describe what you want - "help me understand this repo", "add auth", "review my API"
- **📺 Real-time Claude Streaming**: Watch Claude analyze your code with full repository context
- **🖥️ Flight Cockpit UI**: Status panels, system logs, and live execution monitoring  
- **📋 Task Management**: Upcoming task decomposition with @backend, @frontend, @architect assignments

- **🛡️ Exit Protection**: No accidental closures - your work sessions are protected

### Mission Control Features
```bash
# Launch Mission Control with any natural language query
graphyn "explain the authentication system"

# Mission Control provides:
✅ Repository context detection (package.json, README, structure)
✅ Real-time Claude output streaming
✅ Flight cockpit status monitoring
✅ Session history and query tracking
🚧 Task approval workflow (REV-073)
🚧 Split-screen with inline input (REV-071) 
🚧 Exit protection dialog (REV-072)
```

## 🚀 Agent Revival: Bring Your Agents to Life!

Do you have static `.claude/agents` files? Transform them into living, learning AI agents with one command:

```bash
# During project initialization
graphyn init

# Or revive agents anytime
graphyn agents revive
```

When Graphyn detects your `.claude/agents` folder:
- 🎯 **Found 5 static agents! Want to bring them to life?**
- Select which agents to transform
- Converts static prompts to living Graphyn agents
- Agents learn from every conversation
- Collaborate with your team
- Deploy as APIs

**Before**: Static markdown files that never improve
**After**: Living agents that learn, evolve, and collaborate

## 🔧 API Integration

Graphyn provides a powerful REST API for building custom integrations:

### Authentication

```bash
# Set your API key (optional - will prompt when needed)
graphyn auth gph_sk_your_api_key
```

### API Examples

```bash
# Extract Figma design via API
curl -X POST https://api.graphyn.xyz/v1/design/extract \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gph_sk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"figma_url": "https://figma.com/file/xyz/Component"}'

# Create custom agent
curl -X POST https://api.graphyn.xyz/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gph_sk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "FinTech UI Agent",
    "description": "Specialized for financial dashboards",
    "configuration": {
      "prompt": "You specialize in secure financial UIs..."
    }
  }'

# Chat with agent
curl -X POST https://api.graphyn.xyz/v1/agents/agent_123/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer gph_sk_your_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a secure transaction form"}'
```

### CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Action example
- name: Extract Figma Design
  run: |
    curl -X POST https://api.graphyn.xyz/v1/design/extract \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GRAPHYN_API_KEY }}" \
      -d '{"figma_url": "${{ github.event.inputs.figma_url }}"}'
```

### JavaScript SDK

```javascript
import { GraphynClient } from '@graphyn/sdk';

const graphyn = new GraphynClient({
  apiKey: process.env.GRAPHYN_API_KEY
});

// Extract Figma design
const component = await graphyn.design.extract({
  figmaUrl: 'https://figma.com/file/xyz/Component'
});

// Chat with agent
const response = await graphyn.agents.chat('agent_123', {
  message: 'Build a payment form with Stripe'
});
```

```bash
# OAuth authentication (port 8989)
graphyn init
# → Opens browser for GitHub/Figma OAuth
# → Stores secure Better Auth tokens
# → Creates organization context

# Build agents through conversation
graphyn thread
# → Start agent builder conversation
# → Natural language agent creation
# → Test in WhatsApp-style interface

# Deploy agents as APIs
graphyn agent deploy abc123
# → Get API endpoint: https://api.graphyn.xyz/api/v1/agents/abc123/invoke
# → Receive API key for external access
# → Usage tracking and rate limiting included
```

## The Philosophy

**Documentation should be alive.** Not static files that rot in repos, but living knowledge that grows with your project. Every interaction teaches Graphyn about your codebase. Every decision gets remembered. Every pattern gets recognized.

This is the future of development: AI that truly understands your project.

## Your AI Development Squad

### 🔧 Backend Agent
Expert in APIs, databases, and server architecture. Knows Encore.ts, Node.js, and cloud patterns.

### 🎨 Frontend Agent  
Master of UI/UX, React, and modern web. Builds components that users love.

### 🏗️ Architect Agent
Your technical advisor. Reviews designs, suggests improvements, ensures best practices.

### 🎨 Design Agent
Converts Figma prototypes to working code. Analyzes designs, creates implementation plans, and launches Claude Code with full MCP integration.

## 🔧 Process-Driven Development Architecture

Graphyn CLI follows a **process-mapped development approach** where each component is tracked as a numbered process (PROCESS-001 through PROCESS-012) for systematic troubleshooting and end-to-end delivery.

### Build Status Analysis

Current build has **22 TypeScript errors** across 3 files. Here's the process-by-process breakdown:

#### **PROCESS-001: Type System Integration** ❌ BROKEN
- **Issue**: Missing Claude Code SDK global declarations
- **Files**: `src/clyde/interactive-shell.ts`, `src/engines/standalone-engine.ts`
- **Errors**: `Cannot find name 'Task'` (3 occurrences)
- **Fix**: Create `/src/types/globals.d.ts` with proper SDK declarations

#### **PROCESS-008: Event Streaming Pipeline** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: No real-time event streaming during orchestration
- **Location**: `/src/orchestrator/EventStream.ts` (missing)
- **Impact**: Users can't see live progress during multi-agent execution
- **Fix**: Implement SSE-style event emitter with console streaming

#### **PROCESS-009: Dynamic Engine Methods** ❌ BROKEN  
- **Issue**: 8 missing method implementations in `dynamic-engine.ts`
- **Missing Methods**: `testRemoteAgent`, `updateRemoteAgent`, `deleteRemoteAgent`, `cloneAgentRepository`, `forkAgentRepository`, `startRemoteThread`, `inviteToThread`, `leaveThread`
- **Errors**: 18 TypeScript errors
- **Fix**: Implement missing methods or remove unused calls

#### **PROCESS-010: API Client Type Alignment** ❌ BROKEN
- **Issue**: Agent/Thread interfaces missing required properties
- **Missing Properties**: `status`, `capabilities`, `lastModified`, `created`, `lastActivity`
- **Files**: `/src/api-client.ts`
- **Fix**: Extend interfaces to match backend API schema

PROCESS-012: Figma Integration ✅ PRESERVED

BROKEN CHAIN: Process-008 blocks real-time user feedback
```

### Real-Time Streaming Architecture

The CLI should stream events like this:
```bash
$ graphyn "build API"
🚀 Analyzing query and decomposing tasks...
🔄 @architect: Designing system architecture... 15%
🔄 @backend: Implementing REST endpoints... 30%  
📊 @test-writer: Creating integration tests... 45%
✅ @architect: System design complete
🔄 @backend: Database migrations running... 60%
✅ Mission Complete! API built with tests
```

Currently shows: Static progress updates only
**Needed**: Live streaming with `process.stdout.write()` and event emitters

## Local Development Setup

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/graphyn/graphyn-code.git
cd graphyn-code
npm install

# Build (will show 22 errors currently)
./scripts/build-ink.sh

# Or build orchestration engine (newer architecture) 
npm run build
```

### Build Status
- **Ink.js Build**: ❌ 22 TypeScript errors 
- **Orchestration Engine**: ✅ Builds successfully
- **Runtime Test**: Use `npm run dev` to test new architecture

### Testing Process Sequence
```bash
# TEST-001: Type system compilation
npm run build          # Should compile without errors (after fixes)

# TEST-002: CLI entry routing  
graphyn "test query"    # Should parse and route correctly

# TEST-003: Event streaming
graphyn "build API" --stream  # Should show real-time progress

# TEST-004: Multi-agent coordination  
graphyn "complex task"  # Should launch parallel sessions

# TEST-005: Figma preservation
graphyn design <url>    # Should extract and generate code
```

### Architecture Status
- **Old Ink.js UI**: 2,500+ lines, complex React components ❌ Build broken
- **New Orchestration**: 980 lines, invisible coordination ✅ Working
- **Event Pipeline**: Missing real-time streaming ⚠️ Needs implementation
- **Type System**: Disconnected between old/new code ❌ Needs alignment

### Figma OAuth Setup

The Figma OAuth credentials are embedded in the code for local testing:
- Client ID: `YbqfPAJUb1ro4HEUVuiwhj`
- Client Secret: `4ZXEVoSX0VcINAIMgRKnvi1d38eS39`
- Redirect URI: `http://localhost:3456/callback`

To authenticate with Figma:
```bash
graphyn design auth
```

To use Figma design extraction:
```bash
# Extract and generate components from a Figma prototype
graphyn design <figma-url>

# Extract components with i18n-ready translation mapping
graphyn design <figma-url> --extract-components
```

The `--extract-components` flag provides:
- Automatic text extraction from all components
- Smart translation key generation (e.g., `button.addToCart.action`)
- Component categorization using atomic design principles
- Generated translation files (en.json)
- Components with built-in i18n hooks
- TypeScript types for translation keys

**Note**: These are test credentials for local development. For production, create your own OAuth app at https://www.figma.com/developers/apps

## Living Documentation

Create a `GRAPHYN.md` file in your project:

```markdown
# Our Stack
- Backend: Encore.ts with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind
- Auth: Clerk
