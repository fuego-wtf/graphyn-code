## Session 2025-07-19T23:20:26.207Z

### Agent: cli
**Query**: 
⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Examine current InitGraphyn component implementation  
     ☒ Check graphyn-folder utility for initialization logic
     ☒ Identify what's missing or broken in init function
     ☒ Make init function run automatically on CLI startup
     ☒ Examine what the 'init' command does
     ☒ Remove init-graphyn command since it will be automatic
     ☐ Document all initialization flows
     ☐ Decide which init flows to keep/remove
     ☐ Implement simplified initialization
     ☐ Test automatic initialization on fresh project

✻ Thinking…

  Let me create a clear explanation of all initialization flows for the user.

⏺ I'll help you understand all the initialization flows. Here's what currently exists:

  Current Initialization Flows

  1. .graphyn Folder Creation (Now Automatic)

  - What: Creates .graphyn/ folder with docs structure
  - When: Now happens automatically on CLI startup
  - Creates:
    - .graphyn/init.md - Session notes
    - .graphyn/docs/sitemap.md - Project structure
    - .graphyn/docs/servicemap.md - Service architecture
    - .graphyn/docs/temp/ - Temporary docs

  2. graphyn init - OAuth Onboarding Flow

  - What: Interactive onboarding with OAuth
  - Steps:
    a. Detects repository and framework
    b. GitHub OAuth authentication
    c. Figma OAuth authentication
    d. Agent selection wizard
    e. Demo component generation
    f. Shows pricing/features
  - Purpose: Full platform onboarding for new users

  3. Authentication Commands

  - graphyn auth [key] - Direct API key authentication
  - graphyn design auth - Figma-specific OAuth
  - graphyn whoami - Check auth status
  - graphyn logout - Remove credentials

  Simplified Approach

  Based on your feedback, here's what I recommend:

  1. Remove graphyn init - It's too heavy for a CLI tool
  2. Keep automatic .graphyn folder creation - Already implemented
  3. Simplify authentication to:
  - graphyn auth - Single command for all auth needs
  - Auto-prompt for auth when needed (on first API call)

  Would you like me to:
  1. Remove the init command entirely?
  2. Create a simpler graphyn auth flow that handles everything?
  3. Make authentication happen automatically when needed?

  The goal should be: User types graphyn and it just works - no complex setup required.
