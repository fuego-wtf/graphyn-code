# GRAPHYN.md - Living Project Memory

## Project Vision

Graphyn Code transforms Claude Code from a tool into an intelligent development partner by orchestrating context-aware AI agents that understand your project deeply.

**v10 Architecture**: CLI-first development with MCP integration and local SLM prioritization

## Architecture Documentation

For comprehensive technical documentation:
- **CLI Commands & UI**: See `/code/sitemap.md` - Complete command reference
- **User Flows**: See `/code/temp/USER_FLOW.md` - Detailed interaction patterns and entry points
- **Service Architecture**: See `/code/servicemap.md` - Technical architecture and integration patterns

## v10 Architecture: Claude Code Multi-Agent Initializer

### Core Philosophy
**Transform Claude Code into a multi-agent development team** through dynamic agent composition, intelligent orchestration, and seamless MCP integration.

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: Graphyn Code is a multi-agent initializer for Claude Code, NOT a wrapper!

### Key Components

#### 1. CLI-First Development
- **@graphyn/code** as the primary interface
- Repository-aware agents that understand entire codebases
- Automatic pattern detection and learning
- Zero-configuration for most projects

#### 2. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration
- Enhanced Claude Code experience
- Repository context injection
- Agent knowledge sharing
- Tool augmentation for specialized tasks

#### 3. Local SLM Optimization
- **fuego-mini**: Lightning-fast code analysis (< 50ms)
- **fuego-toy**: Interactive development assistant
- **fuego-mid**: Complex reasoning tasks
- **fuego-doodle**: Creative UI/UX generation
- 576GB RAM optimization for concurrent streams

#### 4. Enterprise Reinforcement Learning
- Continuous improvement from usage
- Pattern recognition across projects
- Team knowledge aggregation
- Automated prompt refinement

## Core Platform Features

### Persistent AI Memory
Unlike traditional AI assistants that forget everything between sessions, Graphyn agents maintain persistent memory through our Thread API.

```typescript
// Each thread maintains context across sessions
const thread = await client.threads.create({
  metadata: { customerId: '12345', role: 'financial_advisor' }
});

// Day 1: Customer asks about portfolio
await client.threads.sendMessage(thread.id, {
  content: "My risk tolerance is moderate, focusing on tech stocks"
});

// Day 30: AI remembers everything
await client.threads.sendMessage(thread.id, {
  content: "Should I rebalance?"
});
// Response: "Based on your moderate risk tolerance and tech focus..."
```

### Repository Context Detection
The CLI automatically understands your project:
- Detects frameworks (Next.js, React, Vue, etc.)
- Identifies patterns (custom hooks, component structure)
- Learns conventions (naming, file organization)
- Adapts generated code to match your style

## Technical Architecture

### Service Layers
```
1. CLI Layer (@graphyn/code)
   - Ink UI for beautiful interactions
   - Direct Claude Code integration
   - MCP server for enhanced context

2. API Layer (GraphynAPIClient)
   - Standard REST + SSE
   - No special CLI endpoints
   - Unified authentication

3. Intelligence Layer (Strands)
   - Python-based agent runtime
   - Direct AI provider integration
   - Auto-scaling infrastructure

4. Storage Layer
   - PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - Redis cache (5-10 min TTL)
   - Thread-based memory
```

### v10 Implementation Plan - Multi-Agent Initializer

#### Phase 1: Multi-Agent System Core (Immediate - 4 hours) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Repository Analysis Module**: Detect stack, patterns, conventions ✅
- **Agent Recommendation Engine**: Dynamic agent composition based on task ✅
- **MCP Coordination Protocol**: Thread messages with metadata ✅
- **Git Worktree Manager**: Isolated workspaces for each agent ✅

**Implementation Status**: All core modules implemented and tested

#### Phase 2: Team Builder Integration (4 hours) 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **API Connection**: Connect to live api.graphyn.xyz ⏳
- **Multi-Agent Creation Flow**: Natural language to agent team deployment ✅
- **Agent Configuration**: Dynamic agent setup based on context ✅
- **Thread Management**: Create and monitor multi-agent threads ⏳

**Next Steps**:
1. Test connection to production api.graphyn.xyz
2. Verify Team Builder agent responds correctly
3. Add thread monitoring UI
4. Test end-to-end multi-agent creation flow

#### Phase 3: MCP Server Enhancement (2 hours)
- **Multi-Agent Context Provider**: Share agent team info with Claude
- **Task Coordination**: Track agent progress via MCP
- **Repository Context**: Enhanced code understanding
- **Learning Capture**: Track accepted solutions

**Implementation Tasks**:
1. Update MCP server configuration
2. Add multi-agent-aware context providers
3. Implement task tracking protocol
4. Add learning feedback mechanism

#### Phase 4: Production Deployment (2 hours)
- **Connect to api.graphyn.xyz**: Live backend integration
- **Authentication Flow**: Seamless OAuth with multi-agent permissions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation if backend unavailable
- **Performance**: Optimize for instant multi-agent team creation

#### Integration Pattern
```typescript
// CLI uses local models for instant analysis
const analysis = await localModel.analyze(repository);

// Enhanced context for Claude
const context = {
  repository: analysis,
  patterns: await learning.getPatterns(),
  team: await knowledge.getTeamInsights()
};

// MCP provides to Claude Code
await mcp.provideContext(context);
```

## Current State

### CLI Status: MULTI-AGENT INITIALIZER READY ✅
- **Dynamic Multi-Agent Creation** - NO TEMPLATES, every agent team is unique
- **Repository Analysis** - Detects stack, patterns, conventions
- **Team Builder Integration** - Creates perfect agent team for each task
- **MCP Coordination** - Agents work together via thread messages
- **Git Worktree Isolation** - Each agent has separate workspace
- **Zero-Config Intelligence** - Just type `graphyn "add auth"`

### Key Understanding: Graphyn Code is NOT a wrapper!
- **Multi-Agent Initializer**: Creates dynamic Claude Code teams
- **NO Special Endpoints**: Everything uses existing thread APIs
- **Exception**: code.graphyn.xyz/ask for Team Builder access
- **Coordination**: Via thread messages with MCP metadata

### Platform Progress: 95% Complete
- **Backend**: 95% complete (Strands fully integrated)
- **Frontend**: 95% complete (Just /api → /admin fixes needed)
- **Multi-Agent System**: 80% complete (Team Builder testing needed)
- **Infrastructure**: Production ready

## Living Documentation Notes

This file evolves with the project. Update it when:
- Making architecture decisions
- Learning technical constraints
- Discovering integration patterns
- Implementing v10 features

Last updated: 2025-01-27 - Multi-Agent Architecture

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **NO FIXED TEMPLATES** - Every agent team is dynamically created
2. **Thread-Based Coordination** - No special endpoints needed
3. **Repository Context** - Analyzed locally, sent to Team Builder
4. **Learning System** - Captures successful solutions automatically
5. **Git Worktrees** - Prevents conflicts between agents

## Success Metrics

- CLI startup time < 500ms
- Local model inference < 50ms
- Claude launch time < 1s
- Repository analysis < 5s
- Zero manual configuration
