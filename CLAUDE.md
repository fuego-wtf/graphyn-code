# CLAUDE.md - Graphyn Code Project Context

## Project Overview
Graphyn Code is a CLI tool that enhances Claude Code with specialized AI agents for backend, frontend, and architecture development. It provides context-aware prompts and manages agent interactions.

**Current Status**: Undergoing major UI rewrite from Commander.js to Ink framework (React for terminals) for better user experience and real-time updates.

## Core Intelligence Strategy (Updated January 2025)

**Key Principle**: The CLI becomes intelligent by **consuming Graphyn agents**, not by building its own intelligence.

### What This Means
- CLI asks agents: "What should the user do next?"
- CLI sends natural language to agents: "Test my customer service agent" ‚Üí Agent interprets
- Agents maintain context about user's work session
- Agents provide suggestions, analytics, and insights
- CLI is the orchestration layer, agents are the intelligence layer

### Implementation Approach
```typescript
// Instead of building intelligence in CLI
// ‚ùå const suggestion = analyzeUserPattern(history);

// CLI consumes agent intelligence
// ‚úÖ const suggestion = await askAgent('cli-assistant', {
//      query: 'What should the user do next?',
//      context: { currentTask, recentCommands, projectState }
//    });
```

## Key Learnings

### Ink Framework Migration (January 2025)

**Status**: Migrating Graphyn CLI from Commander.js to Ink framework - same framework Claude Code uses.

**Progress**: 3 of 17 tasks completed
- ‚úÖ Minimal Ink app created and working
- ‚úÖ ESM build pipeline configured
- ‚úÖ Main menu component implemented
- üîÑ Currently implementing Zustand state management (Task 4)

**Challenges**:
1. **Terminal Control**: Both apps need exclusive TTY access
2. **ESM Modules**: Full migration to ES module system
3. **State Management**: Shifting from imperative to reactive patterns
4. **Component Architecture**: Complete UI rewrite needed

### Claude Code Terminal Integration Issues (January 2025)

**Problem**: Claude Code uses Ink (React for terminals) which requires exclusive raw mode access to stdin. This creates fundamental conflicts when trying to launch Claude from another process.

**Failed Approaches**:
1. ‚ùå Direct spawning with `stdio: 'inherit'` ‚Üí Terminal conflicts
2. ‚ùå Piping content via stdin ‚Üí "Raw mode not supported" error  
3. ‚ùå Detached processes ‚Üí Claude still can't initialize properly
4. ‚ùå Terminal cleanup before spawn ‚Üí Conflicts persist
5. ‚ùå New terminal window with piping ‚Üí Same raw mode issues

**Root Cause**: Claude Code must be the primary process with full terminal control. It cannot function as a child process or with piped input.

**Current Solution**:
- Save agent context to temp file
- Try direct launch: `claude "content"` (may work in future)
- Fallback: Show user commands to run manually
- Support `/read` command after Claude launches

## Architecture Decisions

### Agent Management
- Each agent (backend, frontend, architect) has its own prompt file
- Contexts are combined with user queries dynamically
- Temp files used for context passing to avoid argument length limits

### UI/UX Design
- Beautiful ASCII banner with gradient colors
- Interactive menu for agent selection
- Clear visual feedback with styled boxes
- Graceful fallbacks when automation fails

### Error Handling
- Always provide multiple options to users
- Clear error messages explaining why something failed
- Save context to files as backup
- Show manual commands when automation fails

## Technical Constraints

### Terminal Limitations
- Cannot spawn Claude Code reliably from Node.js
- Both Graphyn and Claude use Ink - cannot run simultaneously
- Must exit Graphyn cleanly before launching Claude
- Ink requires exclusive raw mode terminal access

### Platform Differences
- macOS: Can try osascript for new terminal windows
- Linux: Limited automation options
- Windows: Not yet tested

## Logging & Analytics (Added January 2025)

### What We Log
- Every agent interaction (query, timestamp, agent type)
- Full context files saved to `~/.graphyn/contexts/{agent}/`
- Daily log files in `~/.graphyn/logs/`
- Metadata for each interaction (JSON format)

### Why We Log
1. **Debug Issues**: Track what contexts were sent to Claude
2. **Usage Patterns**: Understand how users interact with agents
3. **Context History**: Users can retrieve previous contexts
4. **Analytics**: Build better agents based on real usage

### Commands
- `graphyn history` - View recent interactions
- `graphyn history -n 20` - View last 20 interactions

### Privacy Note
- All logs are stored locally in user's home directory
- No data is sent to external servers
- Users can delete logs anytime from `~/.graphyn/`

## Interactive Mode Behavior (Updated January 2025)

### Auto-Exit Feature
- Interactive mode now auto-exits after preparing Claude context
- No more "Would you like to do something else?" prompt
- Shows "Exiting graphyn. Happy coding!" message
- Gives 1 second for instructions to display clearly

## API Architecture (Updated January 2025)

### BREAKTHROUGH: Live Backend Integration Available!

**Platform Status**: Backend APIs are 100% operational with real PostgreSQL database!

### Core Principle: Standard API Client
Graphyn CLI connects to the working Encore.dev backend using the same APIs as the web frontend.

```typescript
// REAL API integration (not mock!)
const graphyn = new GraphynClient({ 
  apiKey: process.env.GRAPHYN_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://your-encore-app.com' // Live backend!
});

// Real database operations
const threads = await graphyn.get('/api/threads'); // Actual PostgreSQL data
const agents = await graphyn.get('/api/agents');   // Real agent configs
const stream = graphyn.sse('/api/threads/123/stream'); // Live SSE!
```

### CLI's New Role: Power User Interface
With live APIs, CLI becomes the **developer interface** to the platform:

1. **Testing Interface** - Validate all backend functionality
2. **Multi-Claude Orchestration** - Launch multiple instances for learning demo
3. **Bulk Operations** - Mass management of threads/agents
4. **Real-Time Monitoring** - SSE streaming for live updates

### Demo Support Strategy
**Target**: Help platform reach 100% demo readiness

```typescript
// Demo workflow: CLI-driven agent learning
await graphyn.post('/api/threads', { type: 'testing' });
await graphyn.post('/api/threads/123/participants', { type: 'agent', id: 'agent-1' });
// Launch Claude with agent context
// Capture learning insights
await graphyn.delete('/api/threads/123/participants/agent-1'); // Trigger learning
```

### Implementation Priority
1. **Replace mock APIs** - Connect to live Encore.dev backend
2. **Real authentication** - Use actual token system
3. **SSE integration** - Real-time updates in terminal
4. **Multi-instance coordination** - Support learning demonstrations

## Future Improvements
1. Monitor Claude Code for stdin support updates
2. Implement advanced orchestration patterns
3. Build plugin system for custom agents
4. Analyze logged interactions to improve agent prompts

## Development Guidelines
- Always test both interactive and command line modes
- Use standard API client, no special endpoints
- Focus on orchestration and user experience
- Document terminal-related issues thoroughly
- Keep UI consistent and beautiful
- **ALWAYS run `npm run test:package` before releasing**
- **Use ESM imports with .js extensions in all TypeScript files**
- **Test Ink components in isolation before integration**
- **Handle terminal cleanup properly when exiting Ink**

## NPM Package Testing (Added January 2025)

### Automated Testing Before Every Release
```bash
npm run test:package  # Tests installation in isolated environment
```

### What This Tests
1. Package builds correctly
2. Installation works in clean environment
3. Postinstall script runs without dependencies
4. CLI commands are accessible
5. No missing dependencies

### Release Process
```bash
# 1. Make your changes
# 2. Test locally
npm run test:package

# 3. Bump version
npm version patch  # or minor/major

# 4. Publish (auto-runs test:package)
npm publish
```

### Why This Matters
- Prevents broken releases (like the chalk dependency issue)
- Catches problems before users experience them
- Tests actual npm installation flow
- Verifies cross-platform compatibility

## Context Mapping Boundaries (Added January 2025)

### Key Learning: Agent Commands Work Through Context Files
All agent commands (frontend, backend, architect, cli) now work properly by:
1. **Preparing context** in temp files instead of direct Claude Code spawning
2. **Showing manual commands** for users to launch Claude Code
3. **Logging interactions** for history and debugging
4. **5-minute cleanup** of temporary context files

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Working approach (implemented)
// ‚úÖ Save context to file ‚Üí Show commands ‚Üí Let user launch Claude
fs.writeFileSync(tmpFile, fullContext);
console.log(`claude "${truncatedPreview}..."`);
console.log(`/read ${tmpFile}`);

// Failed approach (causes terminal conflicts)
// ‚ùå execSync(`claude < "${tmpFile}"`, { stdio: 'inherit' });
```

### Why This Boundary Exists
- Both Claude Code and Graphyn CLI use **Ink framework** requiring exclusive terminal control
- Neither can function as child process or with piped stdin
- Raw mode conflicts are **fundamental** - only one Ink app at a time
- Solution: Exit Graphyn's Ink UI cleanly before launching Claude Code
- This is the definitive solution for Ink-to-Ink app transitions

### User Experience Flow
1. User runs: `graphyn architect "design my system"`
2. CLI prepares full context with agent prompt + query
3. CLI saves to temp file and shows instructions
4. User manually launches Claude Code with context
5. Context auto-cleans up after 5 minutes

This boundary ensures **all agent commands work reliably** without terminal conflicts.
