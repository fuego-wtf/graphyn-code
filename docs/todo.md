# Graphyn Code CLI - Development Tasks

## üß† CLI INTELLIGENCE VIA AGENT CONSUMPTION (TOP PRIORITY - January 2025)

### Core Strategy: Consume Agents, Don't Build Intelligence
The CLI becomes intelligent by orchestrating Graphyn agents. All intelligence features come from asking agents questions and facilitating their responses.

### Immediate Agent Integration Tasks
- [ ] Create CLI Assistant Agent consumption:
    ```typescript
    // CLI asks agents for help
    const nextSteps = await queryAgent('cli-assistant', {
      query: 'What should the user do next?',
      context: { recentCommands, projectState, currentThread }
    });
    ```
- [ ] Natural language command interpretation:
    ```bash
    graphyn "test my customer service agent"
    # CLI sends to agent: "Interpret this command: test my customer service agent"
    # Agent responds with: { action: 'test', target: 'agent', filter: 'customer-service' }
    ```
- [ ] Context awareness through agents:
    - [ ] Agents track user's work session
    - [ ] Agents remember previous commands
    - [ ] Agents understand project state
    - [ ] Agents provide contextual suggestions

### Agent-Driven Features
- [ ] Smart suggestions:
    ```bash
    graphyn suggest
    # Asks agent: "Based on context, what should user do?"
    # Agent: "You just created an agent. Try: graphyn test agent customer-service"
    ```
- [ ] Learning analytics via agents:
    ```bash
    graphyn learning analyze
    # Asks learning agent: "What patterns do you see?"
    # Agent analyzes and reports insights
    ```
- [ ] Debugging with agent help:
    ```bash
    graphyn debug thread-123
    # Asks debug agent: "Analyze this thread for issues"
    # Agent provides detailed analysis
    ```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- [ ] Agent-to-agent conversations:
    - [ ] CLI creates thread for agents to discuss
    - [ ] Facilitates agent collaboration
    - [ ] Aggregates multi-agent insights
- [ ] Agent consensus building:
    - [ ] Ask multiple agents same question
    - [ ] Compare and combine responses
    - [ ] Present unified recommendation

## üöÄ LIVE BACKEND INTEGRATION (URGENT - January 2025)

### BREAKTHROUGH: APIs Are Live!
The backend is 100% operational with real PostgreSQL database. CLI should integrate immediately to support the 80% ‚Üí 100% demo push!

### Immediate Integration Tasks
- [ ] Replace mock authentication with real token system
- [ ] Connect to live Encore.dev backend endpoints
- [ ] Test thread creation/listing with real database
- [ ] Integrate SSE streaming for real-time updates
- [ ] Validate all CLI commands against working APIs

### Demo Support Features (Next 2-3 Hours)
- [ ] Multi-instance Claude Code launcher for learning demo:
    ```bash
    graphyn demo learning
    # Creates test thread
    # Adds agent to thread
    # Launches Claude with agent context
    # Monitors conversation
    # Removes agent (triggers learning)
    # Shows learning insights
    ```
- [ ] Real-time thread monitoring:
    - [ ] Display live participant count
    - [ ] Show message activity
    - [ ] Monitor agent status
- [ ] Bulk operations for testing:
    - [ ] Create multiple test threads
    - [ ] Mass add/remove participants
    - [ ] Batch agent testing

### Live API Integration
- [ ] Update API client configuration:
    ```typescript
    const client = new GraphynClient({
      baseURL: process.env.GRAPHYN_API_URL || 'http://localhost:4000',
      apiKey: process.env.GRAPHYN_API_KEY
    });
    ```
- [ ] Real thread management:
    - [ ] `graphyn threads list` - Show actual database threads
    - [ ] `graphyn threads create` - Create real thread
    - [ ] `graphyn threads join <id>` - Add participant to thread
- [ ] Agent integration:
    - [ ] `graphyn agents list` - Real agents from database
    - [ ] `graphyn agents test <agent-id>` - Test specific agent
    - [ ] `graphyn agents add <thread-id> <agent-id>` - Real participant addition

## üîê Web-Based Authentication Flow (UPDATED PRIORITY)

### OAuth Device Flow Implementation
- [ ] Implement device authorization flow:
    - [ ] Generate device code on `graphyn auth`
    - [ ] Poll `/api/cli/device/token` endpoint
    - [ ] Store tokens securely on success
    - [ ] Handle timeout and error cases
- [ ] Create browser opening logic:
    - [ ] Auto-open browser to auth URL
    - [ ] Display user code prominently
    - [ ] Fallback to manual URL if browser fails
    - [ ] Support `--no-browser` flag
- [ ] Build local callback server option:
    - [ ] Start temporary HTTP server
    - [ ] Listen for OAuth callback
    - [ ] Extract token from callback
    - [ ] Shut down server cleanly

### Authentication UX
- [ ] Design authentication flow UI:
    ```
    üîê Starting authentication...
    
    Enter this code on app.graphyn.xyz:
    ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
    ‚îÇ  ABCD-1234  ‚îÇ
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
    
    Or visit: https://app.graphyn.xyz/cli-auth
    
    ‚†ã Waiting for authentication...
    ```
- [ ] Add success confirmation:
    - [ ] Show user email/name
    - [ ] Display organization name
    - [ ] List available agents
- [ ] Implement auth status command:
    - [ ] `graphyn auth status` - detailed info
    - [ ] `graphyn auth refresh` - refresh token
    - [ ] `graphyn auth logout` - clear tokens

### API Endpoints Required
- [ ] Work with backend team on:
    - [ ] `POST /api/cli/device/code` - initiate flow
    - [ ] `POST /api/cli/device/token` - poll for token

- [ ] Token management:
    - [ ] Access token (short-lived)
    - [ ] Refresh token (long-lived)
    - [ ] Automatic refresh logic

### Security Implementation
- [ ] Secure token storage:
    - [ ] Use OS keychain where available
    - [ ] Fallback to encrypted file (chmod 600)
    - [ ] Never store in plain text
- [ ] PKCE implementation:
    - [ ] Generate code verifier
    - [ ] Create code challenge
    - [ ] Verify on callback
- [ ] Token rotation:
    - [ ] Auto-refresh before expiry
    - [ ] Handle refresh failures gracefully
