- Tests installation in isolated environment
- Verifies CLI commands work
- Checks postinstall execution

### 2. Manual Testing
- [ ] Test all agent commands (backend, frontend, architect, design)
- [ ] Verify auth flow works
- [ ] Check error messages are helpful

### 3. Cross-Platform Testing
- [ ] macOS: Run test:package
- [ ] Linux: Run in Docker/VM
- [ ] Windows: Test in VM (if available)

## Release Process

### 1. Version Bump
```bash
npm version patch  # or minor/major
```

### 2. Final Test
```bash
npm run test:package
```

### 3. Publish
```bash

```
Note: prepublishOnly will automatically run build + test:package

### 4. Post-Release
